CodeReview 3

Welcome to my third CodeReview,

This time, being able to work with Bootstrap, made it a bit easier realising ideas I had in my mind although in some cases
also a bit challenging, not knowing what each class is preset to and having to look up the file a lot. 

Nonetheless I managed to achieve the wanted result and also the responsiveness for Tablets and mobile versions. 

My father in law has this restaurant in Vienna, called the Golden Globe, and I went after this idea and made it "Golden Spoon".
I took all the food pictures from his website and I connected his instagram account to the instagram icon at the bottom. 
For the colours I have been using a colour pallete I found and that it represents his restaurant in someway.
As also in his website he does not use a "hero" image, I did not use one here either. 

I did use a nice logo I found which can be considered a "hero" image as well, since it is the first thing, that one sees 
upon entering the website. 

I did do the extra Reviews page but also I found a nice way to make some rating stars and I put them in the button where,
someone could also rate there directly without having to write something. Of course that is just UI, no actual backend code
behind it to retrieve or send data. 

I have also completed all the JS exercises as you will be able to see in the console. 

The subsections also work as requested 4, 2, 1. I just had to play around a bit with media queries. 

Thank you for your time. 

I wish you a nice rest of the Weekend! 

Kind regards,
Eas
